Environmental Inquiry Minor,18,AGECO 121,N/A,,Select 0-3 Credits,"A grade of C or better is required for all courses in the minor, as specified by Senate Policy 59-10. In addition, at least six credits of the minor must be unique from the prescribed courses required by a student's major(s).; The introductory course offers a broad overview of a topic that relates to an environmental theme. It is designed as a preface to learn about the many disciplines and approaches used to study the environment.; This is the capstone course of the minor which allows students to explore more deeply and recap their study within the minor's curriculum.; Students may not use a course from their major in their chosen cluster. In all cases/clusters, students may substitute up to 3 credits of research topics, internship, or independent studies courses focused on a relevant environmental topic in consultation with an adviser.; This specialization prepares a student to learn about the importance of biodiversity in ecosystems. Over the last 100 years, humans have dramatically reduced the biodiversity on the earth primarily through loss of habitat. Reducing the pressure on the world's biological resources will take political will, scientific research, and creativity in planning. A central focus is on developing effective understanding of land management practices that can enhance the prospects for biological diversity.; This specialization provides insights into the debates and challenges about the distribution and utilization of the world's environmental resources. All people deserve to live in a safe environment regardless of their income, skin color, religion, or gender. Yet, many of the poorest people in the world live in unsafe environmental contexts. Research in many different fields of social science, as well as ethical research, is required to understand how to promote and achieve environmental justice.; This specialization scrutinizes the range of debates, practices, and possibilities guiding discussions of how to achieve equitable and sustainable development. Global and national discussions are beginning to probe how we can move toward a future where resources are more effectively utilized and the environment is maintained while achieving well-being for the whole world. A cross-disciplinary approach is necessary to promote an understanding of these broad discussions.; Students must take 3 credits each of social science, natural science, and arts and humanities courses.; This specialization engages the philosophical and political challenges underpinning concerns of modern environmentalism. People have always contemplated the meaning of the world around them and the ways in which their reality is shaped by the environment. The meaning and value of the ""environment"" therefore depends on a person's range of understandings, ideas, and representations about the physical world. To operate effectively, civil society must be based on open discussions including environmental concerns, and this requires basic levels of ecological literacy.; This specialization emphasizes basic literacy required to understand the debates surrounding water as a resource and offers insights into what people can do to protect and maintain its integrity on a worldwide basis. Water and water resources are central to human life, and yet modern industrialization and human settlement patterns are creating untenable competition for water between humans, and other flora and fauna. Basic science is required to ascertain problems of supply. Social science understanding is required to understand challenges facing water supply and utilization and the search for wise utilization of the world's water resources.; This specialization examines human settlement patterns and their interaction with the environment. Particular emphasis is placed on patterns of development, human movement and migration patterns, as well as environmental impacts. As population increases worldwide, land is increasingly taxed beyond proper capacity. Zoning regulations, suburban sprawl, and uneven settlement that replaces fertile agricultural land have all become major issues within the policy spectrum that must be dealt with to ensure a positive future for the entire world population.; This specialization offers a glimpse into the emerging technology that exists in the energy sector. As the worldwide supply of fossil fuels diminishes, and the demand for those fuels increases, new energy technology must be developed to power our planet. In recent years, energy sustainability and the use of infinite resources have been considered serious options for the first time. Thus, this cluster option employs an interdisciplinary strategy with the goal of educating individuals on a broad range of emerging technologies in relation to energy resources.",https://bulletins.psu.edu/undergraduate/colleges/intercollege/environmental-inquiry-minor/

Global and national discussions are beginning to probe how we can move toward a future where resources are more effectively utilized and the environment is maintained while achieving well-being for the whole world. A cross-disciplinary approach is necessary to promote an understanding of these broad discussions.; Students must take 3 credits each of social science, natural science, and arts and humanities courses.; This specialization engages the philosophical and political challenges underpinning concerns of modern environmentalism. People have always contemplated the meaning of the world around them and the ways in which their reality is shaped by the environment. The meaning and value of the ""environment"" therefore depends on a person's range of understandings, ideas, and representations about the physical world. To operate effectively, civil society must be based on open discussions including environmental concerns, and this requires basic levels of ecological literacy.; This specialization emphasizes basic literacy required to understand the debates surrounding water as a resource and offers insights into what people can do to protect and maintain its integrity on a worldwide basis. Water and water resources are central to human life, and yet modern industrialization and human settlement patterns are creating untenable competition for water between humans, and other flora and fauna. Basic science is required to ascertain problems of supply. Social science understanding is required to understand challenges facing water supply and utilization and the search for wise utilization of the world's water resources.; This specialization examines human settlement patterns and their interaction with the environment. Particular emphasis is placed on patterns of development, human movement and migration patterns, as well as environmental impacts. As population increases worldwide, land is increasingly taxed beyond proper capacity. Zoning regulations, suburban sprawl, and uneven settlement that replaces fertile agricultural land have all become major issues within the policy spectrum that must be dealt with to ensure a positive future for the entire world population.; This specialization offers a glimpse into the emerging technology that exists in the energy sector. As the worldwide supply of fossil fuels diminishes, and the demand for those fuels increases, new energy technology must be developed to power our planet. In recent years, energy sustainability and the use of infinite resources have been considered serious options for the first time. Thus, this cluster option employs an interdisciplinary strategy with the goal of educating individuals on a broad range of emerging technologies in relation to energy resources.",https://bulletins.psu.edu/undergraduate/colleges/intercollege/environmental-inquiry-minor/
Environmental Inquiry Minor,18,,Select one 400-level course from a cluster option other than the one you have chosen (field experience courses are encouraged),,Select 0-3 Credits,"A grade of C or better is required for all courses in the minor, as specified by Senate Policy 59-10. In addition, at least six credits of the minor must be unique from the prescribed courses required by a student's major(s).; The introductory course offers a broad overview of a topic that relates to an environmental theme. It is designed as a preface to learn about the many disciplines and approaches used to study the environment.; This is the capstone course of the minor which allows students to explore more deeply and recap their study within the minor's curriculum.; Students may not use a course from their major in their chosen cluster. In all cases/clusters, students may substitute up to 3 credits of research topics, internship, or independent studies courses focused on a relevant environmental topic in consultation with an adviser.; This specialization prepares a student to learn about the importance of biodiversity in ecosystems. Over the last 100 years, humans have dramatically reduced the biodiversity on the earth primarily through loss of habitat. Reducing the pressure on the world's biological resources will take political will, scientific research, and creativity in planning. A central focus is on developing effective understanding of land management practices that can enhance the prospects for biological diversity.; This specialization provides insights into the debates and challenges about the distribution and utilization of the world's environmental resources.
